# COVID-Analysis

This was related to a defunct project done from a course related to the spread of COVID, before the class professor decided to swap to Python and pursue the analysis of machine learning in genomics. However, I plan on continuing this project in the near future when the course is over in order to analyze the coronavirus pandemic.
